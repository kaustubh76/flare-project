# Project Description
Liquidity constraint is always there in option because of too many strike price for solution of this we use linear formula to calculate other strike option contract using just 2 option strike liquidity position which gives us more batter experience, for getting price feed flare network which give live data feed decentralized way also this helpful in settlement of contract time web3auth is used for login and handling of position.

# How it's Made
The core of OptiPair is built on the Ethereum blockchain, with smart contracts developed using Solidity. The frontend is crafted with React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. For real-time data feeds essential for pricing and settlements, OptiPair integrates with the Flare Network, ensuring that all price information is up-to-date and decentralized.
